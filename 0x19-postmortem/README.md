Outage on June 3, 2022
Overview: On June 3, 2022, our web stack experienced a significant outage that resulted in a service disruption for our customers. The outage lasted for approximately 2 hours and affected all users of our web application. This postmortem report is intended to provide a detailed analysis of the incident, including the root cause, impact, and remediation steps.
Timeline:
12:00 PM: Our team received notification of a service disruption from our monitoring system.
12:05 PM: We began investigating the issue and discovered that our web server was not responding to requests.
12:10 PM: We attempted to restart the server, but were unable to do so.
12:15 PM: We began reviewing system logs and discovered that the server had run out of disk space.
12:20 PM: We identified a large number of log files that had accumulated on the server, consuming all available disk space.
12:30 PM: We implemented a temporary solution to delete old log files and free up disk space.
1:00 PM: We were able to successfully restart the web server and restore service to our customers.
2:00 PM: We completed a full system audit and analysis of the issue.
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was determined to be the accumulation of large numbers of log files on the web server. Our web application was logging a significant amount of data, and we had not implemented an effective log rotation or management strategy. Over time, the log files consumed all available disk space, causing the server to crash and resulting in the service disruption.
Impact: The outage resulted in significant disruption for our customers, causing frustration and inconvenience. It also resulted in a loss of revenue and damaged our reputation for reliability and uptime.
Remediation: To prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, we have implemented the following remediation steps:
Improved log management: We have implemented a more effective log rotation and management strategy, including automatic deletion of old log files and compression of archived logs.
Increased monitoring: We have implemented more comprehensive monitoring of our web stack, including regular system audits and alerts for disk space usage and other critical metrics.
Enhanced incident response: We have updated our incident response procedures to ensure faster response times and more effective communication with customers during outages or disruptions.
Conclusion: We deeply apologize for the disruption caused by this outage and are committed to ensuring the highest levels of reliability and uptime for our customers. We will continue to invest in improving our systems and processes to prevent similar incidents in the future.
